// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

num = a
remainder = a % 2

if remainder = 0
print the number is even

else
print the number is odd


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

creat array of 5 numbers 
array = (a, b, c, d, e)

average = (sum of elements in array)/(length of array)
print average

finding the minimum number in array
min = array[0]
for n = 1 to n = 4
if array[n] < min 
min = array[n]
print min

finding the maximum number in array
max = array[0]
for n=1 to n=4
if array[n] > max
max = array[n]
print max
